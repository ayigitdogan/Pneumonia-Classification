# Pneumonia Classification with PyTorch

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. An early detection and treatment to prevent progression might be crucial due to its fatality rate, which is 5 to 10 percent for hospitalized patients.

This study aims to provide one classification model and one detection model for pneumonia by evaluating the X-Ray images provided in the [pneumonia detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/) in Kaggle. Further information regarding the dataset can be found in the [ChestX-ray8](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315) paper.

The notebook file is configured such that itcan be directly run on Google Colab with a valid Kaggle credential file.
